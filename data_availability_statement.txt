All data used during this personal practice of statistical analysis and data visualisations has
been retrieved via public access from the Forest Research Commission. Any statements made about
patterns, or seeming conclusions drawn from their relation to eachother, occur outside of any
approval given by the Forest Research Commission or its subsidiaries. Findings are not additive to 
any claims made within the conclusions of the original publication, and are done purely for private 
experiment to hone and practice various skills in analysis and visualisation.

My intention is to perform various different forms of analysis and visualisation with no political
preconceptions and minimal (if at all) trimming of the data to be amenable to intended experiments.

This page is not representative of any legitimate study and is instead purely exercise. 

Thank-you for reading this statement.
